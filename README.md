# Authorship-Profiling-on-Twitter-Data

### A breif overview of Authorship Analysis: 
       Authorship analysis deals with the classification of texts into classes based on the stylistic choices
      of their authors. Beyond the author identification and author verification tasks where the style of
      individual authors is examined, author profiling distinguishes between classes of authors studying
      their sociology aspect, that is, how language is shared by people. This helps in identifying profiling
      aspects such as gender, age, native language, or personality type. Author profiling is a problem
      of growing importance in applications in forensics, security, and marketing. E.g., from a forensic
      linguistics perspective one would like being able to know the linguistic profile of the author of a
      harassing text message (language used by a certain type of people) and identify certain characteristics (language as evidence). 
      Similarly, from a marketing viewpoint, companies may be interested in knowing, on the basis of the analysis of blogs and online product reviews, the demographics of
      people that like or dislike their products. The focus is on author profiling in social media since
      we are mainly interested in everyday language and how it reflects basic social and personality
      processes.


      The authorship profiling task is often formulated as a classification problem, where a classifier
      is fed with a text and returns the corresponding gender or native language label. There are many
      machine learning methods that can be used in the classification task. They can be categorised
      into supervised method (like SVM) and unsupervised method (like clustering). 



# AIM of the Task:
      The aim of this challenge is to develop a classifier that can assign a set of twitter texts
      to their corresponding labels. In this assessment, you will focus on the gender classification task,
      where you are required to develop a classifier that can identify the gender of the tweetâ€™s author as
      accurate as possible.
